### Using BCE

You now have a machine that has all the software installed as part of
BCE, including IPython, useful Python packages, R, RStudio, and useful
R packages.

You can get a terminal window that allows you to type commands in a
UNIX-style shell by clicking on the icon of the black box with the *$*
symbol on the top panel. You can start IPython Notebook in the
terminal by simply typing `ipython notebook`, or R by simply typing
`R`. This starts a bare-bones R session. To start RStudio, either type
`rstudio` at the prompt on go to **Applications > Programming >
RStudio**.

You can restart the VM at any time by opening VirtualBox and clicking
on the tab for the VM and clicking "Start" as you did above.

#### Using shared folders to move files between the VM and your laptop
